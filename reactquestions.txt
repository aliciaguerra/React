1. What is React? How is it different from other frameworks?

React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook for building complex, interactive UIs in web and mobile
applications.
The key point in this answer is that React's core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as the 
"V" (View) in MVC architecture. Therefore it has no opinions on the other pieces of the technology stack and can seamlessly
be integrated into any application.

Because React is a smaller library focused on building UI components, it is necessarily different than a lot of other
JavaScript frameworks.
For example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs
(i.e. directives, controllers, services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture
of your application - these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but in many situations, they come at the cost
of flexibility.
By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application's
architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem best -
though it also places the responsiblity of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.

2. What happens during the lifecycle of a React component?
One of the most valuable parts of React is its component lifecycle.
At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories:
1. Initialization
2. State/Property
3. Destruction
Every React component defines these events as a mechanism for managing its properties, state, and rendered output. Some of
these events only happen once, others happen more frequently; understanding these three general categories should help 
you clearly visualize when certain logic needs to applied.
For example, a component may need to add event listeners to the DOM when it first mounts. However, it should probably 
remove those event listeners when the component unmounts from the DOM so that irrelevant processing does not occur.

         class MyComponent extend React.Component {
          //when the component is added to the DOM...
          componentDidMount() {
           window.removeEventListener('resize', this.onResizeHandler);
         }
          
          //when the component is removed from the DOM...
          componentWillUnmount() {
           window.removeEventListener('resize', this.onResizeHandler);
         }
         
          onResizeHandler() {
           console.log('The window has been resized!');
         }
        
        }
  
        #Low-Level Component Lifecycle   
        Initialization        ->     Update                       ->    Destruction
        getInitialSize()          componentWillRecieveProps()          componentWillUnmount()
        getDefaultSize()          shouldComponentUpdate()
        
        componentWillMount()      componentWillUpdate()
        render()                  render()
        componentDidMount()       componentDidUpdate()
        
        With these three general buckets exist a number of specific lifestyle hooks that can
        be utilized by any React - essentially abstract methods - that can be utilized by any React component to more
        accurately manage updates. Understanding how and when these hooks fire is key to building stable components and
        will enable you to control the rendering process (improving performance).
        
        Take a look at the diagram above. The events under "Initialization" only happen when a component is first 
        intialized or added to the DOM. However, the events under "Destruction" only happen once (when the component is
        removed from the DOM). However, the events under "Update" happen every time the properties or state of the 
        component change.
        
        For example, components will automatically re-render themselves any time their properties or state change.
        However in some cases a component might not need to update - so preventing the component from re-rendering
        might improve the performance of our application.
        
            class MyComponent extends React.Component {
             //only re-renderif the ID has changed!
             shouldUpdateComponent(nextProps, nextState) {
              return nextProps.id===this.props.id;
              }
            }
            
  3. What can you tell me about JSX?
  When facebook first released React to the world, they introduced a new dialect of JavaScript called JSX that embeds
  raw HTML templates inside JavaScript code. JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser; it must be transpiled into
  traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and wetback. While many developers understandably have initial knee-jerk
  reactions against it, JSX (in tandem with ESX2015) has become the de facto method of defining React components.
  
           class MyComponent extends React.Component {
            render() {
             let props = this.props();
             return (
              <div className="my-component">
               <a href={props.url}>{props.name}</a>
              </div>
              );
            }
          }
          
    Developers do not have to use JSX (and ES2015) to write an application in React.
    This is certainly true. Having said that, many React developers prefer to use JSX as its syntax is far more 
    declarative and uses overall code complexity. Facebook certainly encourages it in their documentation.
    
    Adopting JSX allows the developer to simultaneously adopt ES2015 - giving immediate access to some wonderful
    syntactic sugar.
    ES2015 introduced a variety of new features to JavaScript that make writing large applications far easier than
    ever before: classes, block scoping via let, and the new spread operator are just a small portion of the additions.
    
         import AnotherClass from './AnotherClass';
         class MyComponent extends React.Component {
          render() {
           let props = this.props;
           
           return (
            <div className="my-component">
            <AnotherClass {...props} />
            </div>
            );
          }
        }
        }
        
     But while ES6 is becoming more and more widespread, it still is far from widely supported by the major browsers -
     so you'll need to use a tool like Babel or webpack to convert everything into legacy ES2015.
     
4. Are you using Flux?
Flux is an architectural pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow - its controlled purpose is to control derived 
data so that multiple components cannot interact with the data without risking pollution.

The flux pattern is generic; it's not specific to React applications, nor is it required to build a React app. However, Flux
is commonly used by React developers because React components are declarative - the rendered UI (View) is simply a function
of state (Store data).

Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View

In Flux pattern, the store is the central authority for all data; any mutations to the data must occur within the store.
Changes to the Store data are subsequently broadcast to suscribing views via events. Views then update themselves based
on the new state of recieved data. 

To request changes to any store data, actions may be fired. These actions are controlled by a central dispatcher; actions 
may not occur simultaneously, ensuring that a store only mutates data once per action. 

The strict undirectional flow of this Flux pattern enforces data stability, reducing data-related runtime errors
throughout an application.

Flux vs MVC
Traditional MVC patterns have worked well for separating the concerns of data (model), UI (view), and logic (controller) -
but many web developers have discovered limitations with that approach as applications grow in size. Specifically, MVC
architectures frequently encounter two main problems:
-Poorly defined data flow: the cascading updates which occur across views often lead to a tangled web of events which is
difficult to debug. 
-Lack of data integrity: Model data can be mutated from anywhere, yielding unpredictable results among UI. 

With the flux pattern, complex UIs no longer suffer from cascading updates; any given React components will be able to 
reconstruct its state based on data provided by the store. The flux pattern also enforces data integrity by restricting
direct access to the shared data.

For example, imagine we have a "master/detail" UI in which the user can select a record from a list (master view) and
edit it using an auto-populated form (detail view).

With an MVC architecture, the data contained within the model is shared between both the master and detail views. Each
of these views might have its own controller delegating updates between the model and the view. At any point the data
contained within the model might be updated - and it's difficult to know where exactly the change occured. Did it happen
in one of the views sharing that model, or in the controllers? Because the model's data can be mutated by any actor in
the application, the risk of data pollution in complex UI's is greater than we'd like.

With a flux architecture, the store data is shared between multiple views. However this data can't be directly mutated -
all of the requests to update the data must pass through the Action>Dispatcher chain first, eliminating the risk of random 
data pollution. When updates are made to the data, it's now much easier to locate the code requesting those changes.

Differences with AngularJS
UI components in AngularJS typically rely on some internal $scope to store their data. This data can be directly mutated
from within the UI component or greater application which relies on that data. 

By contrast, the flux pattern encourages the use of immutable data. Because the store is the central authority of all data,
any mutations on that data must occur within that store. The risk of data pollution is greatly reduced.

Testing
One of the most valuable aspects of applications built on Flux is that thier components become incredibly easy to test. 
Developers can test and recreate the state of any React component by simply updating the store - direct interactions with 
the UI (with tools like Selenium) are no longer necessary in many cases.

Popular Flux Libraries
While flux is a general pattern for enforcing data flow through an application, there exist many implementations to chose 
from. There are nuances between implementation, as well as specific pros and cons to consider. 
For example, you might discuss:
Redux: perhaps the most popular Flux library today
Alt.js: another popular library for monitoring data in React applications

5. What are stateless components?
If React components are essentially state machines that generate UI markup, then what are stateless components?
Stateless components (a flavor of resusable components) are nothing more than pure functions that render DOM based
solely on the properties provided to them.

         const Statelesss Cmp = (props) => {
          return (
           <div className="my-stateless-component">
           {props.name}: {props.birthday}
           </div>
           );
           };
         
         ReactDOM.render (
          <StatelessCmp name="Art" birthday="10/01/1980" />
          document.getElementById("main")
          );
          
As you can see, this component has no need for any internal state - let alone a constructor or lifecycle handlers. 
The output of the component is purely a function of the properties provided to it.
